# 🧮 Simple Python Calculator (GUI Version)

A user-friendly calculator built using Python and Tkinter. This project helped me learn how to design graphical user interfaces, manage button events, and handle mathematical operations visually.

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a graphical calculator built with Python's Tkinter library. Users can click buttons to input numbers and operators, and view results in a display area. It supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division - with proper error handling.
